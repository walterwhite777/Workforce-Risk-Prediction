# Employee Risk Analytics And Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a data analytics project designed to predict employee churn and provide actionable insights for HR retention strategies. I analyzed 15,004 employee records, uncovering key drivers such as low satisfaction (62.5% churn rate) and low salaries. The project includes a comprehensive analysis, visualizations, and an interactive dashboard.

## Project Purpose
- Identify factors contributing to employee churn using historical data.
- Predict churn risk for a pilot program of new employees.
- Deliver insights to empower HR with data-driven retention strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Visualization**: Google Looker Studio
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aliaagamall/Employee-Risk-Analytics-and-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) via pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Explore `HR Analyzer.ipynb` for EDA and `modeling.ipynb` for predictions (requires PostgreSQL setup).
4. View the Looker Studio dashboard (link TBD) for interactive insights.

## Key Insights
- Low satisfaction (62.5% churn) and low salaries (29.7% churn) are top churn drivers.
- HR and Accounting departments face the highest attrition (29.1% and 26.6%).
- Workload extremes (2 or 7 projects) correlate with higher churn.

## Recommendations
- Implement employee recognition programs to boost satisfaction.
- Adjust salaries for low-paid employees.
- Optimize workload distribution and offer career development for mid-tenure staff.
